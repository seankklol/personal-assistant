This is a monorepo written in TypeScript. We use Express in the backend, Vite + React in the frontend.

- The backened is in the `./backend` directory
- The frontend is in hte `./frontend`
- We use `bun` instead of `npm` and `bunx` instead of `npx`
- We use React Router v7 for routing in the frontend. This is a newer version for the package, so look it up before making changes to the routing
